    "`\"./HAFS_DATA/07l.2022091806.hfsb.parent.atm.f012.grb2\"`, and write to `\"test_out.nc\"`. The variables of interest are `\"u\"`, \n",
    "which is defined on `\"isobaricInhPa\"` levels, and `\"refc\"`, defined only on `\"atmosphereSingleLayer\"` levels. One other thing to note here - \n",
    "`u` in the result dataset will have dimensions of `lon x lat x level x time`, while `refc` just of `lon x lat x time` since it's only defined on a single level. \n",
