    "Converting from GRIB to netCDF is fairly simple. The user must simply specify an input GRIB file, (`infile`), a \n",
    "file path to output the resultant netCDF data to (`outfile`), the fields to grab from the input file (`fields`), \n",
    "the names of the vertical levels on which these fields are defined (`level_names`), and the subset of levels on which \n",
    "they are defined to write to the netcdf (`field_levels`). In the example code below, the user wishes to read in data from \n",
    "`\"./HAFS_DATA/07l.2022091806.hfsb.parent.atm.f012.grb2\"`, and write to `\"test_out.nc\"`. The variables of interest are `\"u\"`, \n",
    "which is defined on `\"isobaricInhPa\"` levels, and `\"refc\"`, defined only on `\"atmosphereSingleLayer\"` levels. One other thing to note here - \n",
    "`u` in the result dataset will have dimensions of `lon x lat x level x time`, while `refc` just of `lon x lat x time` since it's only defined on a single level. \n",
